# Random Walk

## Project Description
Random Walk generates random walks and uses [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to visualize
them in a visually appealing scatter graph. A random walk describes a path that something takes
when moving in random discrete steps in a mathematical space. It can model things like a pollen
grain moving across water, a drunkard's steps and even gas particles moving around in a room.

## How to Install and Run the Project
Requirements:
- Python 3
- Matplotlib (refer to the [Matplotlib Getting Started Guide](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/getting_started/)) 

Steps to Run:
- Download the project
- Run the random_walk_visual.py file (example command: `python random_walk_visual.py`)
